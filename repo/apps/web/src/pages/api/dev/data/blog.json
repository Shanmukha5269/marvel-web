What's new? ","tags":["update log","caching","Disqus"],"content":"Hello There üëã,\n\nThis is the first of (hopefully) many articles that I'll be writing about all the new things happening to site. I'll also try to share some of the insights I may have gained (if any) in implementing some feature or fixing a bug. So let's go... One by one.\n\n#Caching \nThis is the biggest update, mainly because of the amount of refactoring that was involved in it and how much time it took. I basically had to change how data fetching worked through out the app.\n\nThe idea was simple. It's to not fetch data that was already fetched. For example in previous version, when you open your student dashboard, the syllabus widget fetches the syllabus data. But after that, if you open your course page, it would fetch syllabus data there also again. \n\n - This is not good for the client because it's wasting energy and network bandwidth in fetching redundant data.\n - it's not good for the server because it has to fullfill 2 similar requests for the same client in the same session.\n - it's not good for the planet.\n\nThe solution was to ‚ú®cache‚ú®. By caching, we'll also save some valuable CPU time on server and use less request charge on the database. \n\nBasically tldr: the app feels faster while you navigate through it and pages load quickly if you visit them again.\n\nBut caching comes with another challenge which is to manage \"stale\" data. Data becomes stale when we're using the cached version of it for too long and when we're not in sync with the latest and greatest from the server. To solve this, we'll have to know when to\njust edit cache and when to re-fetch that particular data, depending on the situation. We edit cache when can exactly predict what change the data has gone through but when we aren't sure about how the data has changed, we'll just have to re-fetch it. \n\n#Comments with Disqus\n\nIn previous version, we didn't really have a way to give feedback on articles that people write. So comments was a much needed feature. I had the following in mind when I thought of implementing comments.\n\n - it has to be threaded like reddit comments and not like YouTube comments.\n - comments should have some sort of rating system. Whether through likes or upvotes-downvotes.\n - it should have some level of moderation control.\n\n\n![Disqus logo](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQOD2XfxRkUNjD8fn2j5lDoAWSlcM9EEH3_0w&amp;usqp=CAU)\n\n\nImplementing all these is mostly straight-forward but takes lot of time and effort. That's where Disqus comes to rescue. Discus comes with all these features out of the box for \"free\" and it even supports gifs inside comments. Integrating Disqus was very much straight forward and quick.\n\nGo-ahead and leave a comment below this article.\n\n#better dashboard\n\nSubmissions and review widget now have search and filter capabilities. And we have cleaner looking alert that pops up when something happens, Instead of the browser default alert box. Since we now have caching, we also have a way to voluntarily re-fetch cache. The refresh button on top right of a widget lets you refresh data of that particular widget. It'll be enabled after 5mins to stop you from refreshing too much.\n\n#other updates\n\nInstructors can now edit the intro section of a course. And we no longer have opening and closing of submissions. Students can submit their project report of current level whenever ever they want, but instructors can choose to not approve late submissions if they want.

?","tags":["tutorial","markdown"],"content":"Many people seem confused with writing an article and ended up using the whole thing in a weird way or not using it at all. So, in this article I'll explain everything that's possible with Markdown and embeds so you can write better articles.\n\n#Structure your content and use Hierarchy.\nI've seen some reports where the whole thing is just a dump of one block of text. Please don't do that. Use Headings and other Markdown features to show some structure and Hierarchy in your content.\n\n### Use Headings of different size.\n![Heading of different](https://github.com/abhishek-yanjarappa/marvel-coursework/blob/main/Guide/heading.gif?raw=true)\nThere are 6 different Heading sizes but most of the time you'll only need the top 3. Make use of them.\n\n### Use Markdown features \nTry to use **Bold**, *Italic*, ~~Strikethrough~~, `single-line code`, Multi-line code and Blockquotes wherever possible.\n\n```\n#Multiline code snippet. Here's some code.\nn, m = [ int(i) for i in input().split(\" \") ]\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        print(str(i) + str(j))\n\n```\n\n&gt; Blockquotes are great. \n&gt;\n&gt; -Mater Oogway\n\nThe default behavior of how a new-line is inserted in Markdown is that it adds a newline when you add an empty line in between (except inside a Multiline code-block). So if you want a new line, you'll have leave an empty line in between. And, Markdown features like Blockquotes and multi-line code-block work only when they have an empty line above them. So the above paragraph looks like this in the editor.\n\n![](https://github.com/abhishek-yanjarappa/marvel-coursework/blob/main/Guide/markdown-features.png?raw=true)\n\nNotice how I didn't have to add empty line for code inside of 3 backticks (`). That's how Multi-line works. All the spacing, tabs, newline are rendered just the way you write it.\n\n#Images and GIFs\n\nI've seen some people writing multiple blogposts instead of one project report, just so they can upload images in the cover-photo section of the blogpost. Please don't do that. That's not the intended way to use the site. Cover photo is for making the cover of your blogpost look good.\n\n\nAnyways, you can embed an Image or GIF in your project report wherever you want. The syntax to embed images is, `![alt text or description](image link)` You'll also get this syntax template when you click the image icon in the editor. \n\n\nTo embed an Image or GIF, it must be hosted somewhere on the internet from where we can access it. It can be on GitHub, Google Drive, Imgur, Tumblr or any other image/gif hosting site. You have to upload your image/GIF to any of these sites and use the direct link to image/GIF in the above syntax.\n\n\n### GitHub example.\n\n![](https://github.com/abhishek-yanjarappa/marvel-coursework/blob/main/Guide/uploadgit.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Google Drive\n\nEmbedding images that are stored in your Google Drive is not quite straight forward, Follow this [stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53306767/14226268). \n\n### Imgur, Tumblr etc.\n\n - Upload your image/GIF to Imgur or Tumblr or any other site.\n - copy link to image by right clicking on image and selecting *Copy image link*.\n - use the link in your markdown.\n\n#Videos\n\nthere are 2 ways in which you can embed a video in your article. That is either via YouTube or Vimeo.\n\n### Steps\n\n - upload video to YouTube or Vimeo. (Upload as Unlisted or Public).\n - On the video page, click Share.\n - Select embed option. copy the embed code.\n - Paste the iframe code in editor.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/199632914?h=be07687f63\" height=\"360\"></iframe>\n\n# Hosted code snippets with syntax highlighting.\n\nYou can directly write code blocks by using multiline-codeblock with 3 backticks as shown before, but if you prefer code with syntax-highlighting and other features, it is recommended to use [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/) or \n[thiscodeworks.com](https://www.thiscodeworks.com/). \n\n### Github gists\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/abhishek-yanjarappa/aa352c9531d036542962e4ad3d27d639.js\"></script>\n\n### Thiscodeworks.com\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/6271411c225d6c00153a58ee\" height=\"170\"></iframe>\n\n# Advanced usage\n\n### Interactive Data Visualizations with plot.ly\n\n<iframe height=\"400\" src=\"https://plotly.com/~alex/77.embed\"></iframe>\n\n### Kaggle notebooks\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.kaggle.com/embed/ayessa/wine-price-regression?kernelSessionId=94299849\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n\nIf you have any doubts, please leave a comment below.

He saw this and suggested I put in a username, pet name and date of birth fields and see that those items aren‚Äôt included in the password. I immediately got into adding his suggestion. I needed to know how to check if a string is present within a string, it hit me the indexOf() function gives me the index of the character in a string. This might work, I thought to myself. Two hours and a lot of if statements later I got it to work. I sent it to Abhishek, he replied to host it on Github and that he would check it tomorrow. Oh wait, it's 14th June, I worked on the code from 6:00pm - 12:30am felt proud not going to lie.  \n**Day 2 (14/06/2022): -**  \nThe next day I woke up at 8 am and started doing some trial and errors with the code and left to college. I was waiting for the metro when I checked my messages. Abhishek pointed out that I forgot to include case insensitivity. As soon as I reach college, I just add a toUpperCase to my code and got it done with. I meet up with Abhishek at marvel along with Girish. They ask to see my code, so I open up Text Pad. You see it wasn‚Äôt the right platform to use.  \nThey suggest to use Visual Studio Code, I thought okay let's give it a try. I started to code in it and it made it 10 times better to see where I placed brackets, where I got an error and best for all it closed brackets for me automatically. I felt so sorry for myself for what I put me through all these days.  \nNext thing I do is add the date type for my date of birth field, because this adds an interactive calendar which I didn‚Äôt know. The code bugs out creating all sorts of problems. This is because the date value is stored in a (yyyy-mm-dd) formatted string. Now I had to sort the date.   \nOff I go searching for date sorting codes. I finally ended up finding the slice() function that lets you cut a string. So, I used it to cut the string at the particular index values and concatenate it however I please. Now I feel I finished my project and all that is left is the report.  \nEnter Vineeth Raghavan, he points out that the code doesn‚Äôt give different alerts if both username and password are present in the code. How did I miss that, I thought I would be working on my report when I reached home after college but after that I sat down and started working on unique alerts for every different case. I used a if statement that checks if the field length is not zero and used the indexOf chunk in this if statement. This time instead of giving out the alert it gives just the name of the field and stores it in a string, which I concatenate later to give the final message.  \nFinally Success.  \n\n-Meghashyama N Aithal\n\n \n \n\n\n \n","reviewStatus":"APPROVED","feedback":"","rankingScore":1,"coverPhoto":"https://res.cloudinary.com/marvelweb/image/upload/v1657989503/blog/62d2e97e4610d7fe9f8cfc0e.png","createdAt":"2022-07-16T16:38:24.461Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-16T16:38:24.461Z","slug":"journey-of-developing-the-integrity-analyser-meghashyama-aithal","__v":0},{"_id":"62d3b2174610d7fe9f8cfc2c","authorId":"110383941214781102180","authorName":"Abhilash Bhat","authorSlug":"abhilash-bhat","authorImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJz_yqoZDZyg6-Y-Sy4izKSmG8xD6gZoN_rhkTsS=s96-c","authorCourseCode":"NA","title":"Quantum Computing ","tags":["Blog","Quantum computing"],"content":"# Quantum-computing\n\n With the development of VLSI technology to such an extent that the distance between the transistors is reaching the inter-molecular level\nand at these levels, quantum mechanics comes into action. A transistor that's supposed to be off can be turned on if an electron randomly\n decides to tunnel itself through the depletion region. This might not affect a chip of a billion transistors to a great extent but given the number \n of transistors, and their size, the no of transistors going rogue may also increase. And this affects the normal functioning of a processor and affects the\n performance of the device. \n\n&gt; ![Screenshot (27)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80198193/174319283-0fb6f129-bb5e-47ab-91ac-50e6679216f8.png)\n\nBut what if we use these disadvantages to our advantage? As engineers our task is to get the best out of the worst stuff and why not from this?\n Well here comes quantum computing.\n\n## What is Quantum computing?\n Quantum computing is a sophisticated approach to making parallel calculations, using the physics that govern subatomic particles to replace the more simplistic transistors in today‚Äôs computers. \n&gt; \nJust like how there's binary 1 and 0 for our current logic quantum computers use something known as a qubit. Qubits are computing units that can be on, off, or any value between, instead of the bits in traditional computers that are either on or off, one or zero. The qubit‚Äôs ability to live in the in-between state ‚Äî called superposition ‚Äî adds a powerful capability to the computing equation, making quantum computers superior for some kinds of math.\n\n&gt; ![Screenshot (28)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80198193/174319217-25d9f885-84df-4521-b5bf-0f2be3e9e871.png)\n\n### How does a Qubit work tho?\nThe two most relevant aspects of quantum physics are the principles of superposition and Entanglement. Taken together, quantum superposition and entanglement create an enormously enhanced computing power. Where a 2-bit register in an ordinary computer can store only one of four binary configurations (00, 01, 10, or 11) at any given time, a 2-qubit register in a quantum computer can store all four numbers simultaneously, because each qubit represents two values. If more qubits are added, the increased capacity is expanded exponentially.\n In the case of traditional bits each of them can hold one value, either 1 or 0.\n ### Working of Quantum Computer\n Using qubits, quantum computers could buzz through calculations that would take classical computers a very long time ‚Äî if they could even finish them. In 2019, for example, Google claimed to carry out a calculation in about 200 seconds that would take a classical supercomputer around 10,000 years. \n\nComplex problems that would take hundreds of variables to solve are a huge burden even for a modern-day supercomputers. But this stuff is trivial for quantum computers, but that does'nt mean that they will finish it in a short time. These process may take a long time but much faster than the super-computers. \n&gt; \n  Thanks to features like superposition, a quantum computer can use eight qubits to represent every number between 0 and 255, simultaneously. While in traditional computers it would take 2^8 bits of data to represent the same amount of number. There is a decrease in a very huge amount of space and memory.\n\nIt‚Äôs a feature like parallelism in computing: All possibilities are computed at once rather than sequentially, providing tremendous speedups.\n\nSo, while a classical computer steps through long division calculations one at a time to factor a humongous number, a quantum computer can get the answer in a single step. \n\nThat means quantum computers could reshape whole fields, like cryptography, that are based on factoring what are today impossibly large numbers. But there can be disadvantages to it too. Passwords that seems impossible to crack with supercomputers can be cracked easily by the quantum computers.\n\n&gt; ![Screenshot (26)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80198193/174318845-7e41cbb0-111f-4673-8dc1-dc0527e5b8ec.png)\n\n### Quantum computers in our world\nA handful of companies such as Alibaba, Google, Honeywell, IBM, IonQ and Xanadu operate early versions of quantum computers today.\nToday they provide tens of qubits. But qubits can be noisy, making them sometimes unreliable. To tackle real-world problems reliably, systems need tens or hundreds of thousands of qubits.\nExperts believe it could be a couple decades before we get to a high-fidelity era when quantum computers are truly useful. There is the IBM's 127 qubit quantum computer which is a major breakthrough but as said it would take more than five decades for these stuff to be household products, but then again who knows? same stuff was said for the modern day computers about 60 years ago and yet here we are.\n\n### Disadvantages \nAfter all these usefull stuff on quantum computing there are some limitations that cannot be neglected\n\nThey‚Äôre difficult to build. As we saw with IBM‚Äôs Quantum System One, a functional quantum computer needs a very specific set of conditions to operate. They require unique components, massive cooling systems, and expensive technology to run at even a basic level. \n \n Due to the nature of quantum mechanics and qubits, environmental factors can soon produce errors and lose their quantum state (a process known as decoherence). These errors multiply with levels of complexity, which means that to reach their potential, a solution for error correction is needed. \n\nAs we‚Äôll see, quantum computers have the potential to deliver revolutionary solutions in some specific areas. However, due to the nature of how they work, they‚Äôre not expected to offer advantages in all areas of computing. \n### Conclusion\n  Despite all the disadvantages quantum computing is one of the only few ways forward for humanity to progress. Faster processing and less memory. It is all upto the humans to utilise this properly and ensure that the human civilisation grows towards an utopia\n","reviewStatus":"APPROVED","feedback":"","rankingScore":1,"coverPhoto":"https://res.cloudinary.com/marvelweb/image/upload/v1658040857/blog/62d3b2174610d7fe9f8cfc2c.jpg","createdAt":"2022-07-17T06:54:17.894Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-17T06:54:17.894Z","slug":"quantum-computing-abhilash-bhat","__v":0},{"_id":"62d3cdf84610d7fe9f8cfc4b","authorId":"109921042053760259478","authorName":"Mohammed Nowfal","authorSlug":"mohammed-nowfal","authorImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh79V1CJfzcGeg4-v_GdhYBh5anxrdcHsi2NN8asQ=s96-c","authorCourseCode":"NA","title":"About MARVEL","tags":[],"content":"# MarvelBlog\n## MARVEL\n\n\n&gt; *\"Words may inspire but actions creates change!\"* ~ **Simon Sinek**\n\n\n**MARVEL** is a recently set-up R&amp;D Laboratory in University Visveswaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore. It is a solely student run environment, \nfunded by the alumni through the **UVCE Graduates Association** and is taken care by Mr. Satish A G, whom the students refer to as \"Satish anna\". It is located beside the library next to Minchu. It is a place where innovative and enthusiastic minds get together and work on projects and curate a syllabus for new learners. A system without any hierarchy, where all the students are trained to handle any given situation in the most diplomatic way possible.  \n\n![hey](https://github.com/sinpaiiii/MarvelBlog/raw/main/UVCE_03.jpg)\n\n#### When and how it started?  \n\n&gt; *\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"* ~ **Lao Tsu**  \n\n\n\n![](https://github.com/sinpaiiii/MarvelBlog/raw/main/IMG-20220616-WA0080.jpg)\n\nThe club was inaugurated  on **15th September, 2021**, the *co-ordinators* have kept the lab up and running since then. On December, 2021 the first batch of *students* entered the lab after shortlisting about thirty out of a hundred applicants. The first batch officially ended the level one of their respective domains on June. (The above-mentioned roles will be briefly discussed below)\n\n## Domains\nThere are **five domains** in MARVEL, out of which the students are allotted one. Each domain has *three levels* and each level contains *certain number of tasks*. The students are expected to complete their set of tasks and submit a report before the start of next batch. The domains are as follows:  \n\n- [IoT](https://hub.uvcemarvel.in/course/IOT-001) \n- [AI-ML](https://hub.uvcemarvel.in/course/AI-ML-001)\n- [Design and Prototyping](https://hub.uvcemarvel.in/course/D-P-001)\n- [Electric Vehicle and Reneewable Energy](https://hub.uvcemarvel.in/course/EV-RE-001)\n- [Cloud Computing and Cyber Security](https://hub.uvcemarvel.in/course/CL-CY-001)\n\n## Roles\n\n&gt; *Who are we beyond the roles that we play?* ~ **Joan Anderson**  \n\n#### 1. Co-ordinator  \nThis is the a**dministrative** and **management** role in MARVEL. A wide variety of tasks fall under this category, to name a few, inventory management, keeping record of the students' progress and ensuring their attendance, drafting letters and broadcast messages for events, forming the syllabi, troubleshooting errors and a lot more. Every co-ordinator is a representative, a **brand ambassador of MARVEL** itself.   \n  \n#### 2. Student  \nA student is the \"learner's role', the people who wish to get to know and dive deep into one of the listed above domains. They are expected to complete their given set of tasks and submit a report when a term ends. \n  \n#### 3. Project-Team (in progress)\nThis set of people are expected to work on a project and submit weekly updates. To be accepted as one, a project proposal is made and on approval of the UVCEGA they are allotted funds and kept an eye on.  \n\n## Events  \n\nTeam MARVEL has conducted various seminars and workshops, that were open for all students of UVCE. One wouldn't be surprised on seeing a student explain the working of an IC, a simple k-map, and a lot more on the white board to anyone who is interested. In conclusion MARVEL is the place for learning and innovation, the entire environment keeps one motivated and instills the stive for perfection.  \n\nHere are some snaps from previously conducted sessions:  \n\n![](https://github.com/sinpaiiii/MarvelBlog/raw/main/IMG-20220616-WA0085.jpg)  \n\n![](https://github.com/sinpaiiii/MarvelBlog/raw/main/IMG-20220616-WA0086.jpg)  \n\n![](https://github.com/sinpaiiii/MarvelBlog/raw/main/IMG-20220616-WA0087.jpg)  \n\n\n\n## Contact and Social Media  \n\n[website](https://hub.uvcemarvel.in/)  \n  \n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uvcega/)  \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/visionuvce/)\n","reviewStatus":"APPROVED","feedback":"","rankingScore":1,"coverPhoto":"https://res.cloudinary.com/marvelweb/image/upload/v1658047993/blog/62d3cdf84610d7fe9f8cfc4b.png","createdAt":"2022-07-17T08:53:13.764Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-17T08:53:13.764Z","slug":"about-marvel-mohammed-nowfal","__v":0},{"_id":"62d4499c4610d7fe9f8cfd65","authorId":"110953451063544920497","authorName":"Greeshma Sharma","authorSlug":"greeshma-sharma","authorImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhUiHIkw_csgoA9jOusGcEbjS943FFvS4G8LroDpA=s96-c","authorCourseCode":"NA","title":"What are we?","tags":[],"content":"### Something MARVEL-ous  \n\n\n  \n**MARVEL** is the foresight that VISION UVCE is opening into the worlds of future students.

You may download the ISO from [here.](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.4/)\nEnsure that you download the Desktop image.\n\n## Creating a bootable USB stick\nFor this step, you will need to download a software utility called [Rufus.](https://rufus.ie/en/)\n\n![](https://rufus.ie/pics/rufus_en.png)\n\nOnce you have downloaded it, plug in a USB flash drive of at least 8GB capacity into your computer and write the ISO file into it. The image shows version 18.04, but the procedure is the same for version 20.04 as well.\n\n## Booting into the USB flash drive\n\nPlug in the Bootable USB flash drive that you just wrote the ISO to, into the computer on which you want to install Ubuntu. Turn on the computer, head into the BIOS and choose the USB flash drive as the boot device. \n\n![](https://expertreviews.b-cdn.net/sites/expertreviews/files/styles/er_main_wide/public/2015/08/boot_priority_with_usb_drive.png)\n\n## Installing Ubuntu 20.04\nOnce you have successfully booted up into the USB flashdrive, you should see the Ubuntu Welcome screen:\n\n![](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/6855ab78-welcome-screen.png)\n\nSelect \"Install Ubuntu\", and proceed with the installation. \n\n### Setting Up the keyboard layout\nChoose the appropriate keyboard layout from the list below. Usually, Ubuntu automatically detects it for you, so it mustn't be too much of a hassle.\n\n![](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/47f9c406-select-keyboard-layout.png)\n\n### Choosing the installation type\n\nChoose between Normal installation or Minimal Installation. The former installs the most basic applications and utilities that the average user would need on a personal computer. The latter installs a minimal version of the operating system which is suitable for power users, who would like to have control over what applications are installed on their machine.\n\n![](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/e2bd1af8-download-updates.png)\n\n### Partitioning and allocating disk space\n\nAt this stage, you have 2 options:\n1. You could erase everything and install Ubuntu. Ubuntu will set up the partition automatically.\n2. You could choose to set up the partitions yourself.\n\n#### 1. Erase Everything and install Ubuntu\nYou just need to click on \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\". The rest of the process will be taken care of by Ubuntu.\n\n![](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/930ca887-continue-installation.png)\n\n#### 2. Allocate partitions yourself.\nHere, you need to click on \"Something else.\" and proceed.\n\nYou will see the following screen:\n\n![](https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Choose-Free-Space-Partition.png)\n\nYou have to set up the partitions on your own here.\nI suggest the following partition scheme:\n\n```\nswap area: Twice the storage capacity of your RAM.\n\n/ - Root mount point: Anywhere from 30GB to 50GB, depending on whether or not you plan on installing a lot of applications.\n\n/home - Home mount point: The space that is remaining can be assigned to the /home partition.\n```\n\n### Miscellaneous settings\n\nSet your location:\n\n![](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/5f9e0960-select-location.png)\n\nSet up your Login credentials:\n\n![](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/422d18ea-login-details.png)\n\nAnd finally, wait for your installation to complete. Make sure that you restart your computer after the installation completes. Also, remove the installation medium when Ubuntu prompts you to.\n\n## Post-install setup\n\nOnce Ubuntu boots up, it will ask you to set up a few settings to make your experience seamless. Ensure that you set up the settings accordingly.\n\nAfter that, connect to the internet, open up the terminal and type the following command:\n\n` sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade `\n\nThe terminal will prompt you for your password. Enter the password and proceed with the update.\n\nIn case you face any issues with the installation process, feel free to post your queries in the [forum.](https://ubuntuforums.org/)\n\nYou have now successfully installed Ubuntu.

The beauty of nature and its critically self-similar elegance is inspiring indeed. Mathematics has given us vast treasures of quintessentially elegant patterns and relations that can be found almost everywhere, right from the turbulence in clouds to the roots of a tree. Nature is uniquely a self emanating engine of mathematics. They are intertwined in every ways and inspire us to make better everytime we design anything.\n\n&gt; Paul Rand ‚Äî 'Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.' \n\nIn this blogpost, we shall learn a few elegant principles of math in nature. \n\n###Fractals\nFractals are infinitely recurring patterns that are self similar across different scales. Self similarity across scales gives it a chaotic image. Fractals are in many ways, concise representations of chaos. It forms an important aspect in chaos theory. \n\nExamples of fractals : \n\n- Branches and roots of trees\n- River Deltas and Catchment basins\n- Blood circulatory system in body\n- Fern leaves\n- Sierpinski triangle\n- Mandelbrot set\n- Hindu yantras\n\n![Fractal Tree](https://www.contemplative.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Oneness.jpg)\n![](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/66/70/24/360_F_366702408_b3udRVLARaMrHIpOXrpAwXLJicaB1hGT.jpg)\n\n###Golden Ratio\n\nIn mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.\n\n***a+b / a = a / b = 1.618.............***\n\nGolden ratio is an irrational number (1.618033.....). It is considered as the most aesthetic ratio in mathematics. The ratio of consecutive higher to lower fibonacci numbers tends to the golden number. The golden ratio has been used in ancient Greek and Egyptian temples to enhance their aesthetics. Eg., Parthenon in Athens. The shell of nautilus almost has a perfect golden spiral. Such elegant mathematical expressions express themselves everywhere in nature in one of the most beautiful ways. \n\n![Golden ratio](https://www.imaginary.org/sites/default/files/styles/gallery-full/public/111111.jpg?itok=IJPrjKZ-)\n\n![Parthenon](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a3/1c/5e/a31c5e5f9dc0187e525194d4bf787286.png)\nParthenon and the golden spiral\n\n##Few prominent design elements which have used mathematics for enhancements\n\n![Apple](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B8CkQKUCMAEBVFB.jpg)\nApple \n\n![Twitter](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/81/83/69/8183694f53963c635884d74532fa070c--bird-logos-surface-design.jpg)\nTwitter\n\n![Rolls Royce](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/34/67/81/346781c5ecbbab2675fd6194fa611bed.jpg)\nRolls Royce","reviewStatus":"APPROVED","feedback":"","rankingScore":1,"coverPhoto":"https://res.cloudinary.com/marvelweb/image/upload/v1661022998/blog/630131e76dd94e949e935fa5.jpg","createdAt":"2022-08-20T19:11:37.800Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-21T11:39:13.259Z","slug":"elegance-in-design-rahul-ramesh","__v":0},{"_id":"6390259887e981722d953d8d","authorId":"115226457739720150827","authorName":"Suresh","authorSlug":"suresh","authorImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ALm5wu0-Ei0IPPg5XPgA1PAcDAvU_a8TJR-L8I8UE74w=s96-c","authorCourseCode":"EV-RE-001","title":"TASK_2","tags":[],"content":"learnt the dual H_BRIDGE ,where a h bridge is used to control the direction of an individual dc motor,the gates of the mosfets are given an PWM-signal which decides the amount of current that flows through the dc motors which indeed decides the rotation speed of the dc motors.L298N has two H-BRIDGES which can be used to drive two dc motors at a time.the image of an L298N DRIVER MODULE can be seen at:","reviewStatus":"PENDING","feedback":"","rankingScore":1,"coverPhoto":"https://res.cloudinary.com/marvelweb/image/upload/v1670391193/blog/6390259887e981722d953d8d.jpg","createdAt":"2022-12-07T05:33:13.577Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-06T03:28:21.421Z","slug":"task_2-suresh","__v":0},{"_id":"63e2af6ac630c137e9590c50","authorId":"117195121744424483017","authorName":"Sujay Vikram G S","authorSlug":"sujay-vikram-g-s","authorImage":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GitOGBEFqUYSplo02SK8pZkPe4DGcPySYSKZFip=s96-c","authorCourseCode":"CL-CY-001","title":"Mobile Markdown ?","tags":["Mobile","Markdown"],"content":"So you could actually make a blog post from your mobile phone device and its quite simple \n\nFor the cover page you get to choose an image from your mobile gallery or storage and only images are allowed for the same as common sense mandates\n\nYou get to write whatever **and choose to have markdown features too**\n\n*I've used italics when I pressed the I button way up there*\n\n**I had to scroll a bit for the same**\n\n![cute cat waving bye](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/991518926/vector/goodbye-summer.jpg)\n\n[Cute cat bidding goodbye=](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/991518926/vector/goodbye-summer.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=is&amp;k=20&amp;c=MzSBlC3W20_yIcHeZPn16jc7_GQ-7LD2_a3QcWRKxEA= )\n\n\nSo maybe the preview doesn't work when on the mobile phone\n\nWe don't know \n\n\nNow what if I tried the desktop version option?\n( Will copy all of this to the clipboard, just in case)\n\n##A few moments later \nMy hunch was right there is no autosave, so careful\n\nOoh and the preview was the same \n\nSo thats it \nByeee\n\n\n\nP.S : it's the same for selecting relevant tags as it is on the website \n\nP.s P.s :: you always get to edit your blogs before it's been approved and by the time you read this this blog wudve been approved\n","reviewStatus":"PENDING","feedback":"","rankingScore":1,"coverPhoto":"https://res.cloudinary.com/marvelweb/image/upload/v1675800556/blog/63e2af6ac630c137e9590c50.jpg","createdAt":"2023-02-07T20:07:08.611Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-07T20:09:16.556Z","slug":"mobile-markdown-sujay-vikram-g-s","__v":0}]

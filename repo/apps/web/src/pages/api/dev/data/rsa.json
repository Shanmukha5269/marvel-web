The datasheet is generally written by the manufacturer of the component. For common/unbranded components such as LEDs, resistors etc. it is suggested that you collect the most important parameters(Power rating, supply voltage, operating temperature etc.) during purchasing. \n\nFor most ICs/transistors, a datasheet is a god send. It eliminates ambiguity from your design and allows you to design proper circuit topology, identify errors in your circuit etc.\n\nSo how do you interpret a datasheet?\n\nDatasheets for each component are read differently. There is no set format or guideline that every datasheet follows. However, a good datasheet always contains the following:\n\n1. Description of the component\n\n2. Maximum and minimum parameters\n\n3. Physical dimensions\n\n4. Pinout diagrams+pin function descriptions\n\nIf you have any questions regarding datasheets, ask one of your co-ordinators. \nUser manuals for all the equipment available in MARVEL are stored in the lab. Ask the co-ordinator on duty if you want to use any of the documents.\n\nDatasheets are freely available online.

It is also known as additive manufacturing. A 3D printer is used to 3D print objects. It builds the object layer by layer. There are metal 3D printers and polymer 3D printers. Both of them work very differently but fundamentally, the object is prepared by building layer upon layer.\n\n Less wastage and ability to manufacture sophisticated objects are the perks of 3D printing. The cost of capital machinery for manufacturing a product is way less in 3D printing as it relies on the principle of additive manufacturing.\n\nThe main parts of a 3D printer are as follows. \n\n- Filament\n- Extruder\n- Hot End\n- Print bed\n\n![Parts of a 3D Printer](http://my3dconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hardware-components-of-FDM-3D-Printers.jpg)\n\n###How does it work ?\n\nCAD software is used for designing an object. After it has been designed according to the required specifications, we must convert it to .stl file which shall be interpreted to g-code. G-code guides the 3D Printer for additive manufacturing of the object. \n\nFor any printer to work, it requires a source file which shall be processed to make the product. Object file is created by rapid prototyping using CAD software. Object file is converted to .stl file ( Stereolithograph file ).\n\n![](https://fabheads.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/slicer13-1.png)\n\n \".stl file\" is the source file for 3D printing. Stereolithograph file sliced to computer numerical code called g-code. G-code instructs the 3D printer to manufacture the object.\n\n*G-code is a widely used computer numerical code - CNC programming language. It is used in CAM ( Computer Aided Manufacturing ).*\n\nCartesian coordinate configured robotic arm shall hold the extruder element. The extruder has a heating element, which shall melt the polymer filament(Eg., PLA filament) and layer by layer, the object is manufactured. \n\n###3D Printing softwares and open resources\n Ultimaker Cura is a prominently used 3D printing software. It is a open source slicing engine for converting the .stl file to CNC. Using this software, we can begin our journey with 3D Printing.\n\nUltimaker Cura Download Link : [https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)\n\n[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) is an open-source website where we can find and collaborate our ideas with the 3D printing community. Here, one can download the .obj files of myriad available objects from the website. \n\n ### Ultimaker Cura for Splicing and 3D Printing\nIn order for anything to be printed, the scale, dimensions, material, infill(density and pattern), and support structures are a few important things to remember.\n\n#### Infill Patterns\n![infillpattern](https://the3dbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cura-Infill-Patterns.jpg)\n\n#### Support Structures\nThey are required for building layers of filament while printing in overhanging regions. Support structures are printed along with the object. They are relatively soft and can be broken off later to get the finished object.\n\n![Red-Object\nBlue-Support](https://support.ultimaker.com/hc/article_attachments/4405598827922/UseTowers.png)\n\n###Resource Links :\n\n- [3D Printing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/3d-printing)\n- [CNC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/computer-numerical-control)\n- [CAM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/computer-aided-manufacturing)\n- [Rapid Prototyping](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/rapid-prototyping#:~:text=Rapid%20prototyping%20(RP)\n- [Study Materials from Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/learn)","tags":["3D Printing","additive manufacturing"],"rankingScore":1,"createdAt":"2022-08-20T18:08:15.582Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-22T06:07:48.806Z","slug":"3d-printing-rahul-ramesh","__v":0}]

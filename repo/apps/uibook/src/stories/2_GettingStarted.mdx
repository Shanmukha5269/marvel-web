<Meta title="Introduction/Getting Started" />

# Installation:

get started by installing the component library:

```powershell
npm install @uvcemarvel/react-ui
```

if you are using a pnpm monorepo workspace,

```powershell
pnpm install @uvcemarvel/react-ui --filter app_name
```

# Usage:

# Import Styles

Before you start using the components, import the stylesheet at the root of your project.

```tsx
import "@uvcemarvel/react-ui/styles.css";
```

You can start importing components and use them like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@uvcemarvel/react-ui";
```

# Next.js and other SSR frameworks:

Next.js 13^ requires the client component file to have a `“use client”;` directive at the top. To support this, the library has separate exports for client and server components.

### Import server components as:

```tsx
import { MarvelLogo, MarvelLogoMark } from "@uvcemarvel/react-ui/server";
```

### Import client components as:

You can export all client components from within your Next.js project like so:

in your components/marvel-ui.tsx:

```tsx
"use client";
export * from "@uvcemarvel/react-ui/client";
```

and you can import client components like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from "../components/marvel-ui.tsx";
```

# Dark mode:

The components are styled for both light and dark mode. Toggling between the two modes can be done by setting the data-theme attribute to light or dark in the root HTML tag of your page. The implementation of how you toggle the modes is up to you. If you are using Next.js, we recommend using the next-themes package to manage the persistence and toggling of modes.

```html
<html lang="en" data-theme="dark">
  <!-- page contents -->
</html>
```

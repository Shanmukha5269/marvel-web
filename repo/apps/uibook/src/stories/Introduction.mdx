# Welcome to UVCE Marvel's Design System Docs

Marvel Design System Docs is a comprehensive collection of design guidelines, UI components, and assets that enable consistent, accessible, and efficient design across all Marvel projects. The design system is a solution to the problem of inconsistent design. The Marvel Design System Docs ensure that all Marvel products have a consistent look and feel, which improves the user experience and helps to build brand recognition.

The design system includes guidelines for typography, color, layout, and spacing, among other design elements. These guidelines ensure that designers and developers can create visually appealing and consistent designs with ease. The UI components included in the design system are designed, tested, accessible and adhere to web-standards (ARIA), allowing developers to save time and effort when building new products. The design system also includes a library of assets, such as logos, images, and illustrations, that can be used across all Marvel products.

The Marvel Design System Docs should be regularly updated to reflect changes in design trends, and org needs. This ensures that the design system stays current and relevant.

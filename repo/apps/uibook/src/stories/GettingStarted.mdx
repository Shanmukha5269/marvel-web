<Meta title="Introduction/Getting Started" />

# Installation:

get started by installing the component library:

```powershell
npm install @uvcemarvel/react-ui
```

if you are using a pnpm monorepo workspace,

```powershell
pnpm install @uvcemarvel/react-ui --filter app_name
```

# Usage:

You can start importing components and use them like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@uvcemarvel/react-ui";
```

# Next.js and other SSR frameworks:

Next.js 13^ requires the client component file to have a `“use client”;` directive at the top. To support this, the library has separate exports for client and server components.

### Import server components as:

```tsx
import { MarvelLogo, MarvelLogoMark } from "@uvcemarvel/react-ui/server";
```

### Import client components as:

You can export all client components from within your Next.js project like so:

in your components/marvel-ui.tsx:

```tsx
"use client";
export * from "@uvcemarvel/react-ui/client";
```

and you can import client components like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from "../components/marvel-ui.tsx";
```
